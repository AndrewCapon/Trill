## Trill Libraries and Examples

The repository holds the Bela, Linux and Arduino libraries for Trill and examples.

## Connecting Trill

Trill sensors connect via I2C (3V3, GND, SCL, SDA). The pins are labeled on the boards. In this repo we have the library for Bela, Linux (Raspberry Pi for example) and Arduino with examples for each of the different sensor types.
